# litter
>**litter**: *rubbish such as paper, cans, and bottles left lying in an open or public place.*

Twitter is trash, and this is a twitter clone.

# summary
Basic microblogging service made using Flask and PostgreSQL.

# (planned) features
It's unlikely there will be more than the most basic features you'd expect from a microblogging service - you should be able to make an account, create posts, follow other users and see their posts, and reply to those posts.

# current state
You can register and post messages, follow users and reply to posts.

# demo
Login at https://litter-tsoha.herokuapp.com/ with user / resu (passwords for most other accounts are also the username backwards)

# todo
* refactoring as needed (needed a lot)
* spend more than 5 minutes on security stuff
* validate input on client side (currently throws errors)
* maybe user roles (admin/normal user) and post deletion?
* whatever comes to mind
