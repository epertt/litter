# litter
>**litter**: *rubbish such as paper, cans, and bottles left lying in an open or public place.*

Twitter is trash, and this is a twitter clone.

# summary
Basic microblogging service made using Flask and PostgreSQL.

# (planned) features
It's unlikely there will be more than the most basic features you'd expect from a microblogging service - you should be able to make an account, create posts, follow other users and see their posts, and reply to those posts.

# current state
You can register and post messages as well as follow other users and see their messages.

# demo
Login at https://litter-tsoha.herokuapp.com/ with user / resu

# todo
* replying to other users messages
* refactoring as needed
* css/js/etc
* everything else
